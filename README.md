# Classic Arcade Game Clone 

## About

This is a clone of the Classic Arcade Game for Udacity's Front End Web Developer Nanodegree. 

## Getting Started 

The game can be accessed by opening the "index.html" file in a web browser.

## Instructions

The goal of this game is to get your player across the cobblestone street to the water without being hit by any bugs zooming by! You start off with three lives. You receive points for making it to the other side without being hit. Succesfully making it to the other side will take you up to a more advance level where bugs move even faster! If you are hit one of your lives is deducted and your player starts off back at the grass. The game is over when you run out of lives. Move your player by using the arrow keys on your keyboard. You need to move in order to get across and to avoid bugs. You can use the up key to move forward, the down key to move back, the left key to move left, and the right key to move right. Good luck!
